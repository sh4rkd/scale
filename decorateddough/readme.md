The error occurs because the page detects that a user is not visiting it, so certain characteristics of the PDP load differently, in this case it was Breadcrumbs. Unfortunately, there is no way to avoid this and you can check it if you open a tab in incognito. Breadcrumbs will be different from the one displayed when browsing normally, I attach 3 images of the same PDP displayed with both the crawl, personal browser and incognito mode.
