The video extraction request is not possible because the links that are generated are random in each section, so the extraction of the link is not feasible

We wanted to choose to reconstruct the video but there is no way since the necessary codes were not found.

The only thing that could be found were video chunks in .ts format with a random time in seconds, with a file which contains all the chunks but the reconstruction by that means is not viable since we do not have the necessary tools for it.
